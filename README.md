# GitHub Hello World

Commits to personal repositories are [counted as contributions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#commits)
in the GitHub contribution graph on your profile. We can abuse this behaviour to paint arbitrary pictures in past years
that previously had no contribution listed. This script takes a 51x7 binary image to create commits that will show the
image in the contribution graph.
